# Rust Berlin Matrix Chat

Rust Berlin hosts their own [Matrix] server under chat.berline.rs.

It has 2 major channels for our meetups:

* `#hack-and-learn:chat.berline.rs` ([Join Channel link][hack-and-learn-channel]).
* `#rust-and-tell:chat.berline.rs` ([Join Channel link][rust-and-tell-channel]).

If you already have a Matrix account you can join the channels by clicking the `Join Channel` links above.

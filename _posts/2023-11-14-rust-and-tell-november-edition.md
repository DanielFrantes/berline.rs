We are delighted to announce the next edition of Rust and Tell Berlin!
We are greatful that GitButler is hosting us this time!

**Line-Up**

_Code in Rust with RustRover_ by Vitaly Bragilevsky

RustRover is a Rust IDE recently launched by JetBrains. RustRover implements out-of-the-box experience and provides a lot of functionality for Rust developers.
In this talk, I'll overview the most useful as well as lesser-known RustRover features and show how to use them effectively to get your job done.
Among other things, I'll dive into the RustRover debugger and prove that it's time to abandon the general practice to print things out while debugging your code!

_Meilisearch: Rust based search engine_ by Prasun Joshi

In this talk, we'll dissect Meilisearch - a search engine - to understand how to build performant systems using Rust.
We'll also see it in action by implementing a custom search engine.

Last week, news of the murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department and the subsequent protests in Minneapolis and other cities have reached us and left us shocked.

We, the Rust Berlin organisers, want to make a clear statement:
* We condemn racism of all forms
* We strictly oppose police violence
* We stand alongside Black people & everyone helping in the current situation

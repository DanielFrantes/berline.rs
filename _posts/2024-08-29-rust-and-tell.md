Dear fellow Rusteceans,
The sun is bright and warm, so why not just meet for something social?
Let's bond this time over some drinks and see where the discussion leads us.

We'll meet at the Prater (we will take some photos once we find a spot)
and if we have enough space let's enjoy ourselves there...
if not there is always the Mauerpark or we can make a small journey to the Treptower Park.

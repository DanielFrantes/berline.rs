Due to the current pandemic we’ve canceled the in-person Hack and Learn event.

We still want to provide a venue to meet and we are experimenting with how to provide a good experience for everyone.

This Thursday, 14. May 2020, we're going to meet online.
We’ll be hosting the event via a video meeting on [Zoom] and a [Matrix] channel.

Thursday will be a first test run on how such an event will work.
We're testing out the features and how we can moderate these channels.
This time it might be less about working on Rust projects and instead experimenting around with online venus.
Feel free to join and drop out at any point.

Everyone is invited to join us, no travel necessary.

## Zoom instructions

At 19:00 follow the Zoom meeting invite (Link will follow).
Zoom offers an in-browser video chat or you can use the client after you install it.

## Matrix instructions

If you already have a Matrix account join the `#hack-and-learn:chat.berline.rs` channel ([Join Channel link](https://matrix.to/#/!xycQxSjSAvEezkyztA:chat.berline.rs)).

If you don't have an account you can create one on our server.

1. Open the [Riot webapp][riot].
2. Click "Create Account".
3. Choose "Advanced".
4. Enter this homeserver URL: `https://chat.berline.rs`
5. Pick a username and a password.
    * Caveat: we currently don't allow password resets and can't recover them either. Remember your password!
6. Complete the registration.
7. Now join [the `#hack-and-learn:chat.berline.rs` channel](https://matrix.to/#/!xycQxSjSAvEezkyztA:chat.berline.rs).

One note: We set this server up on short notice.
We don't guarantee to keep it running beyond our Hack'n'Learn for now.

Rust is a language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

Let's meet for open hacking and (co)-learning in our bi-weekly learning group!

Everyone is welcome. Rusties of all skill levels meet and hack on cool Rust stuff. Please bring a computer.

Never written a single line of Rust, but interested in the language? There will be people around to get you set up and going.

Already have a project? Just hack on it or find others interested in contributing. If you have something working, you can put it on the big screen and show everyone.

Don't have a project yet? There are lots of ideas and cool projects floating around that you can work on!

Here are some ideas if you don't know what to hack on:

- Install Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html "https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html") .
- Read the Rust book [https://doc.rust-lang.org/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/ "https://doc.rust-lang.org/")
- Complete Rustlings (a great beginners course!) [https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings "https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings")

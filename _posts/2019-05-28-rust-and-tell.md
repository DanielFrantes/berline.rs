"Rust and Tell“ is a monthly event (the last Tuesday of every month) to share ideas and learn about new things about Rust. Meet fellow Rustaceans, share your learnings, get motivated and inspired! We’re open to any and all kinds of talks about any subjects that you think will be interesting to an audience interested in Rust. Whether you're an experienced Rust developer or just getting started, we strongly encourage you to share your learnings.

Some ideas include but are not limited to: experience learning about async programming in Rust, how to implement a no-std compliant crate for use on embedded systems, or struggles with the borrow checker and how to overcome them. All ideas are welcome!

To apply, please tweet at either [Ryan Levick](https://twitter.com/ryan_levick) or [Bastian Gruber](https://twitter.com/byteadventures) . If you're unsure if your idea will be interesting, submit to us anyway! We can help you refine and improve your talk!

The main idea is to look behind the scenes at a crate, a project or the process of learning Rust in general. Explain how you got started, how you may have struggled and/or succeeded and answer some questions afterwards.

We will have 3 slots, with 20 minutes each. You decide on how you want to fill this time. If you want to use less, also feel free to do so. If you would like longer to speak let us know so we can see if we can arrange for it. It is open to EVERYONE. From absolute beginner to experienced Rust programmers.

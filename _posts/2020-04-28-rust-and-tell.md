"Rust and Tellâ€œ is a monthly event to share ideas, and learn about new things in and about Rust. Meet fellow Rustaceans, share your learnings, get motivated and inspired.

Some ideas include but are not limited to: experience learning about async programming in Rust, how to implement a no-std compliant crate for use on embedded systems, or struggles with the borrow checker and how to overcome them. All ideas are welcome!

To apply, please either write in the comments below or message Ryan Levick or Bastian Gruber on Meetup. If you're unsure if your idea will be interesting, submit to us anyway! We can help you refine and improve your talk!

We will have 3 slots, with 20 minutes each. You decide on how you want to fill this time. If you want to use less, also feel free to do so. If you would like longer to speak let us know so we can see if we can arrange for it. It is open to EVERYONE. From absolute beginner to experienced Rust programmers.

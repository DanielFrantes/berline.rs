With Web3 Summit and Blockchain Week happening in August,
we want to take the time to understand the why and how these type of applications exist and work.
Rust is the first choice when it comes to todays decentralised technologies,
which gives us a head-start in diving into this space to play around with SDKs.

We will hear from Fluence, Nervos and Parity plus you get the chance to meet the people behind the frameworks and be able to ask questions.

The event starts at 7pm in the Parity offices, with plenty of food, drinks and nice people to hang out with!

**ATTENTION**:

Due to the current pandemic we’ve canceled the in-person Hack and Learn event.

We still want to provide a venue to meet and we are experimenting with how to provide a good experience for everyone.

This Thursday, 19. March 2020, we're going to meet online.
We’ll be hosting the event via a video meeting on [Zoom] and a [Matrix] channel.

* Before Thursday please install the Zoom client if you plan to join.
* For Matrix start with the [Riot webapp][riot] and create an account (You can find some alternative home servers in [a list online](https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php). [Other clients][matrix-clients] are available as well.

One caveat: Thursday will be a first test run on how such an event will work.
We're testing out the features and how we can moderate these channels.
This time it might be less about working on Rust projects and instead experimenting around with online venus.
Feel free to join and drop out at any point.

We'll post the Matrix channel details and a Zoom join link on Thursday.
Everyone is invited to join us, no travel necessary.

Further updates will be posted here and on our twitter channel [@RustBerlin](https://twitter.com/RustBerlin) shortly.

Rust is a new systems programming language developed by Mozilla.

Let's meet for open hacking and (co)-learning in our bi-weekly learning group!

Everyone is welcome. Rusties of all skill levels meet and hack on cool Rust stuff. Please bring a computer.

Never written a single line of Rust, but interested in the language? There will be people around to get you set up and going.

Already have a project? Just hack on it or find others interested in contributing. If you have something working, you can put it on the big screen and show everyone.

Don't have a project yet? There are lots of ideas and cool projects floating around that you can work on!

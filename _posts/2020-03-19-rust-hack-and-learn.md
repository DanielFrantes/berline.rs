**ATTENTION**:

The in-person Hack and Learn on the 19th of March is canceled.

Due to the current pandemic we've decided to cancel the upcoming in-person Hack and Learn event.
We're currently trying to provide an online venue for people to meet next week.

Further updates will be posted here and on our twitter channel [@RustBerlin](https://twitter.com/RustBerlin) shortly.

Rust is a new systems programming language developed by Mozilla.

Let's meet for open hacking and (co)-learning in our bi-weekly learning group!

Everyone is welcome. Rusties of all skill levels meet and hack on cool Rust stuff. Please bring a computer.

Never written a single line of Rust, but interested in the language? There will be people around to get you set up and going.

Already have a project? Just hack on it or find others interested in contributing. If you have something working, you can put it on the big screen and show everyone.

Don't have a project yet? There are lots of ideas and cool projects floating around that you can work on!

Since it had been a while, we want to kick off the new Rust meetup season with a pure social event.
Let's meet in a beer garden, sit together and share our latest experiences, sorrow and success with Rust.

**Note**: This will be unsponsored event, and we reserved 25 seats, which have to be taken until 18:45 CEST.

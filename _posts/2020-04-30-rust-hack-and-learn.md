Due to the current pandemic we’ve canceled the in-person Hack and Learn event.
To switch things up a little bit we're not holding our typical Hack'n'Learn online session this time either.

Instead we encourage you join this week's Rust Zürich meetup.

Details:

For the second virtual Rust Zürisee Meetup, we'll have two guests talking about security-related topics.

Christian (aka chrysn) will talk about cargo-crev:
«Don't waste time reviewing crates – make it count instead!
With crev code reviews, we can mesh up our reviews to gain a level of review coverage on,
and thus trust in, our dependencies that would be practically unobtainable alone. Let's join forces to cover our whole dependency trees.»

Tony Arcieri (aka tarcieri / bascule) will talk about cargo-audit and the RustSec Advisory Database.

The talks will start at 19:30 CEST (UTC+2).
Talks will be live streamed on the [Rust Zurich Twitch account](https://www.twitch.tv/rustzurich/).

The live-chat used for questions and general discussion:

[`#rust-zuerisee:matrix.coredump.ch`](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#rust-zuerisee:matrix.coredump.ch).  
(*Note:* This can be joined if you already created an account on the `chat.berline.rs` Matrix server.)

After the talks we'll have some virtual beers together on Jitsi.

We're looking forward to the presentations and hope that many people will join us!

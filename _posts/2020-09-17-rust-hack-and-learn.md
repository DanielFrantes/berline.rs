Rust is a language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

Let's meet for open hacking and (co)-learning in our bi-weekly learning group!

Everyone is welcome. Rusties of all skill levels meet and hack on cool Rust stuff. Please bring a computer.

Never written a single line of Rust, but interested in the language? There will be people around to get you set up and going.

Already have a project? Just hack on it or find others interested in contributing. If you have something working, you can put it on the big screen and show everyone.

Don't have a project yet? There are lots of ideas and cool projects floating around that you can work on!

Here are some ideas if you don't know what to hack on:

- Install Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html "https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html") .
- Read the Rust book [https://doc.rust-lang.org/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/ "https://doc.rust-lang.org/")
- Complete Rustlings (a great beginners course!) [https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings "https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings")
